# Hello, world!

I think it is time to write down, how my C++ superMini server is working.
But to protect myself from all accusation.
I am a noob. And most of the time I dont't know what I am doing.

This project was only born to learn about C++ and well I thought a server is a good idea.

But I promis I am trying to improve.

I also hope with this written version of my thoughts and explination, that maybe I will see mistakes und unecessary code.

I had no idea how to start so obviously I searched in google. But I wanted to understand how it works and not a online tutorial and copy paste some code.
Soooooo, I have read some blog posts from others regarding kqueue and how to solve multiple connections at once and one other Blog. If I find the links again I will provide them here.

## Project Layout
<img src="/src/img/ProjectLayoutMiniHttp.png" alt="logo" width="200" />

In the screenshot we see all files contained in this project.
Each file will be described and what it's purpose is and how it should work.

### main.cpp
The opener is main.cpp couse it is always the starting point of everything in life.

The idea was, that the main is as short as possible without a lot cryptic setup stuff. For now I am happy how it looks.

#### What was the idea
The idea was to just create a server object register the paths with its callback functions and ready to go.

What is what:
- A SimpleHttpServer_t object
  - This is the most important object in the code. As the name gives a hint, the whole logic of the server lives here.
- How to register paths?
  - That was the first challange in the main.cpp the question was how to register paths, http methods and it's callback function.
  - I knew, that I have to somehow catch that three variables which belong together for later processing. So my idea was to use a simple nested map. 
  - And voila registerRequestHandler was born, it is a methode provided by SimpleHttpServer <br>
  
    ```C++
    void SimpleHttpServer_t::registerRequestHandler(
		std::string uri, HttpRequest_t::HttpMethode methode,
		HttpRequestHandler_t callback)
        {
	        requestHandler[uri].insert(std::make_pair(methode, callback));
        }
    ```
    It takes the path as string, methode as enum and a callback.
    The function simply adds the all that to a map called requestHandler.
    This map holds all information about all registered paths and it's.

- What must my handler do?
  - In essence the handler should take a Request and return a Response thats it.
  - So for this task and some help from C++14(I think) I decided to solve this via lambdas. And also I like lambdas<br>
  ```C++
    auto helloWorld = [](const HttpRequest_t& request) -> HttpResponse_t
    {
        // Creating Response Object with StatusCode OK -> 200
        HttpResponse_t httpResponse{ HttpResponse_t::HttpStatusCode::Ok };

        // Preparing answer from server
        std::string resp_msg = "Hello World from Sandi's Server";

        // Building Body
        httpResponse.buildResponseBody(resp_msg);

        return httpResponse;
    };
    ```
    This is a simple lambda expression. The -> is the trailing-return-type which indicates what is the return value of this expression. The type of the variable helloWorld would be **std::function<HttpResponse_t(HttpRequest_t&)**

    ### Example
    Below you can see an example. On how to register a path with its parts.
    ```C++
    // Registering path: /helloworld for GET with helloWorld handler
	server.registerRequestHandler("/helloworld", HttpRequest_t::HttpMethode::GET,
			helloWorld);
    ```
    Now we would have registered **/helloworld** and the server would return us a **"Hello World from Sandi's Server"**<br>

    So this was a brief description regarding the main file.
    It was a one take. And can already tell, that I am not happy with how I have written it down. It's late I should sleep.
